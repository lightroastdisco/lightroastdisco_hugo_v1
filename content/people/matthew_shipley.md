## About
Matthew Shipley was baptized by progressive house, but has since expanded to all genres of foot-moving fare. His live hardware sets are hypnotic with gradually evolving layers of crisp rhythms and futuristic synths. His DJ sets build momentum through mind-bending textures and heavy percussion, breaking open to memorable deep cut moments that make you bust out Shazam.
