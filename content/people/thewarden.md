## About
theWarden, a Chicago native, grew up hearing the sounds of bands like Depeche Mode and Nitzer Ebb which ignited his passion for electronic music from a young age.  He was always drawn to the darker sounds of techno while still loving the levity of house music.  theWarden tries to reconcile the dichotomy of these sounds in his mixes creating driving grooves with playful melodies and chord progressions that always keep is mixes fun and exciting.  As a producer, theWarden likes to create fast groove focused percussive tracks that serve to keep a mix moving foward and the dancefloor shaking.
